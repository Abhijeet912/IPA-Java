Create a Java program that manages hotel information and performs specific operations based on user input. Implement the following:

Class Hotel: Define a Hotel class with the following attributes:

id (int): Unique identifier for the hotel.
name (String): Name of the hotel.
dob (String): Date of booking in the format "dd-MMM-yyyy".
noOfRooms (int): Number of rooms booked.
wifi (String): Wifi availability ("yes" or "no").
totalBill (double): Total bill for the booking.
The class should include:

A constructor to initialize these attributes.
Getter methods for id, noOfRooms, wifi, and a getMonth() method that returns the booking month extracted from dob.
Method noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth:

Define a static method noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth that takes an array of Hotel objects and a String representing a month (e.g., "Jan") as parameters. The method should return the total number of rooms booked across all hotels in the given month.
Method searchHotelByWifiOption:

Define a static method searchHotelByWifiOption that takes an array of Hotel objects and a String representing the wifi option ("yes" or "no") as parameters.
The method should return a list of Hotel objects where the wifi option matches the given string, sorted in descending order by totalBill.
Main Method:

Prompt the user to input data for four hotels.
After reading the data, perform the following:
Call noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth with a user-provided month and print the total number of rooms booked. If no bookings are found for that month, display "No rooms booked in the given month".
Call searchHotelByWifiOption with a user-provided wifi option and print the id of the second hotel in the sorted list. If fewer than two hotels match the wifi option, display "No such option available".
